Welcome, 

NECTAR Stands for "Nash Equilibria CompuTAtion Resource", it is an open source, platform-independent software tool for computing Nash equilibria of strategic form games and extensive form games. It also provides an environment where researchers can carry out experiments using different algorithms. 
Originally developed by Kalyana Chakravarthi under supervison of Prof. Y. Narahari, as part of their course project, Aravind S.R., Arjun Suresh and Deepak Vishwakarma have added distinct modules to this. You can access Kalyan's M.E theis at http://lcm.csa.iisc.ernet.in/gametheory/necter. For a web version of same you can see https://github.com/pvam/NECTAR.

Please go through "UserManuals" folder to see how to run this tool, there will be two seperate versions.

For the pupose of solving integer programming, we have used lpsolve.
